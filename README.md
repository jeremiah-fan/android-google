# Google's Applied CS with Android

<h2> Included are projects built during the course of this six-week class. I extended some of the projects to make them more fun to play. </h2>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Project 1 - Anagrams: </strong> Given a target word, think of as many words that contain the same letters plus one more letter as possible!
<br> <strong> Extension: </strong> Added a timer and a score </li>
<li> <strong> Project 2 - Scarne's Dice: </strong> Roll a die and have that die's value be added to your score for that round. To roll another and potentially lose that or play it safe and end your turn? That is the question. 
<br> <strong> Extension: </strong> Added a second die and subsequently modified the rules </li>
</ul>
