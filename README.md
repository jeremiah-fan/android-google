# Google's Applied CS with Android

<h3> Included are projects built during the course of this six-week class. I extended some of the projects to make them more fun to play. </h3>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Project 1 - Anagrams: </strong> Given a target word, think of as many words that contain the same letters plus one more letter as possible!
<br> <strong> Extension: </strong> Added a timer and a score </li>
<li> <strong> Project 2 - Scarne's Dice: </strong> Roll a die and have that die's value be added to your score for that round. To roll another and potentially lose that or play it safe and end your turn? That is the question. 
<br> <strong> Extension: </strong> Added a second die and subsequently modified the rules </li>
<li> <strong> Project 3 and 4 - Ghost: </strong> Don't be the one to finish a word that you and your opponent are collectively building.
<br> <strong> Extension: </strong> Expanded the UI, implemented DFS for the computer to choose better words to build towards, and added an initial loading screen
<br> <em> Note: </em> For Project 3, the project was built with an ArrayList, whereas I switched to using tries in Project 4. The overall runtime is faster now, but since appending to an ArrayList is faster than inserting into a tree, initialization of the project is slightly slower. I hope to mask this cost by implementing a progress bar instead of just waiting there. </li>
</ul>
